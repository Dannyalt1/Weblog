    <!-- Hobbies Section -->
    <div class="section hobbies">
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Gaming is a very significant part of my life. Gaming and having access to communicate with other players around the world allowed me to have human interaction especially in the pandemic where going outside was strictly prohibited. So with gaming it helped me get through that rough part for the whole world. And meet amazing people whom I trust and created a deep bond with. Gaming also helps with creativity games like Minecraft are a great example of this. And eye to hand coordination games like Geometry dash is one example of that. Games I like to play or have played before are Elden ring an open RPG game, Minecraft a Survival game. And Roblox a gaming platform that has alot of games to offer for whatever genre your looking for.</p>

        <h2>Boxing</h2>
        <p>Boxing is another hobby of mine or passion. I discovered this hobby or passion due to my friend having gloves. I fought a few of my classmates and I discovered that boxing gives me joy with every punch I land and with every punch I take. Boxing is a hobby that has brought me alot of joy even though we only have short sparring sessions. Its a passion that I cannot pursue due to our final situation.</p>
        <p>Boxing isn't just about fighting; it's a great workout that enhances strength, endurance, and confidence. It's also an excellent stress reliever!</p>

        <h2>Cars</h2>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is Cars or liking cars. Ever since I was a kid I was fascinated with cars. Things like Lightning Mcqueen, Optimus prime, Bumblebee, and the Fast and Furious series helped me like cars as a kid. And as a teenager this hobby or liking only grew larger after rewatching the Fast and Furious series making me very interested on JDM cars because of the characters Brian O'conner and Han Lue. Brian has a very iconic blue Nissan Skyline R34, and an orange Toyota Supra, and A green Mitsubishi Eclipse. While Han Lue has a VERY cool looking Veilside wide body Mazda Rx7 FD. And a blue and orange Nissan silvia s15.</p>
        <p>For me cars are not just a metal frame with 4 wheels and an engine under the hood. For me each non electric car has a life, has a soul like us humans. The sound of an engine is very calming to me. And reaching high speeds and risking your life is very thrilling and a way to escape problems. Because its just you and the car while you zoom through traffic, and everything gets left behind in the dust.</p>

    <!-- Ambitions Section -->
    <div class="section ambitions">
        <h2>My Ambition</h2>
        <p>My ambition is to live a quiet and peaceful life, free from the noise and chaos of the world. I value my freedom and my peace of mind, I want to be hugged by nature. Run away in the vast mountains, away from society. Lay on the grass of a hill while I gaze into the night sky and count the stars. And just relax without having to worry about anything and live a very carefree and peaceful life.</p>
        <p>Success, to me, is about finding inner calm, maintaining balance, and appreciating the simplicity of life. And also being wealthy, I am poor and im sick of being poor.</p>
